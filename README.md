# payment-collection-prototype
This is a payment collections (mostly geared toward Venmo) server written using Django REST framework.

For development, clone the project and run:
<br>
<code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>
<br>
<code>cd frontend</code>
<br>
<code>npm install</code>
<br>

You should be ready to start building on top of this project after that.

Branching in this project has been done for the most part chronologically to allow me to go back to past versions and 
implement features differently.
